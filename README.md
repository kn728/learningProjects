#Learning Project
This is where I dump all my practice or tutorial projects that I am using to learn new things or practice programming. Any decent projects I develope in here will enter my portfolio. My aim use this as a learning space. And any notworthy projects I make I will submit into the my portfolio repository. 

Alot of the projects here are unfionished and still being worked upon
